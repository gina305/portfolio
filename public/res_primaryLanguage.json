I've been working in the cyber security industry for last 7 years with my most recent roles focused on security compliance & monitoring and vulnerability management. My recent interest in secure software development was sparked by an innate desire to identify and automate vulnerability remediation and monitoring efforts. ‚≠ê My goal  is to create custom security solutions for companies so they can refocus excess resources (such as man hours, funding and training) to other areas that support their organizational goals. Let me know how I can contribute to your company's security posture üíú",
